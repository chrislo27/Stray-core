Stray
=====
A game made in Java using libGDX.

The source for this project has been split into two parts: the core (this repo), and the desktop version. All issues and wiki articles go here.

Desktop repo: https://github.com/chrislo27/Stray-desktop


To clone this successfully:

1) Create a folder, anywhere you like. It'll be temporary.

2) Clone this repository and the desktop repo into that folder.

3) Import the two projects into Eclipse (sorry IDEA users) as an Existing Project.



To run the game, run DesktopLauncher (in the desktop project).
